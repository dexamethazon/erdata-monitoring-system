# SSH Configuration Management Feature Documentation

## Overview

This document provides additional context and technical details for the SSH Configuration Management feature request for the erdata-monitoring-system.

## Background

The erdata-monitoring-system is designed as a hybrid infrastructure monitoring solution that leverages n8n, SSH, and cloud APIs. SSH connectivity is a critical component for monitoring remote systems, making centralized SSH configuration management essential for:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined SSH host management across diverse environments
- **Security**: Centralized credential management and security policy enforcement  
- **Scalability**: Supporting large-scale infrastructure monitoring operations
- **Compliance**: Meeting enterprise security and audit requirements

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Integration with n8n Workflows
The SSH configuration management system should integrate seamlessly with existing n8n workflows:
- **SSH Connection Nodes**: Enhanced n8n nodes that leverage centralized SSH configurations
- **Configuration Templates**: Pre-configured SSH templates for common monitoring scenarios
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime SSH configuration selection based on workflow context

### Database Schema Requirements
The system will require secure storage for:
```yaml
ssh_hosts:
  - id: unique_identifier
    name: friendly_name
    hostname: ip_or_hostname
    port: ssh_port (default: 22)
    username: ssh_username
    identity_file: path_or_reference_to_key
    proxy_jump: bastion_host_configuration
    ssh_options: advanced_ssh_options
    created_at: timestamp
    updated_at: timestamp
    last_tested: timestamp
    status: connection_status

ssh_keys:
  - id: unique_identifier
    name: key_name
    key_type: rsa|ecdsa|ed25519
    public_key: public_key_content
    private_key: encrypted_private_key
    passphrase_hash: encrypted_passphrase
    created_at: timestamp
    expires_at: timestamp
```

### Security Implementation
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for stored private keys
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 or Argon2 for password-based encryption
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for SSH configuration access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all configuration changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core SSH Management
- Basic SSH host CRUD operations
- Simple authentication (password/key)
- Connection testing and validation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- ProxyJump and bastion host support
- SSH agent integration
- Advanced SSH options configuration

### Phase 3: Import/Export and Bulk Operations
- OpenSSH config file import/export
- Bulk configuration management
- Configuration templates and cloning

### Phase 4: Security and Compliance
- Advanced encryption and key management
- Compliance reporting and audit trails
- Integration with enterprise identity systems

## API Design Principles

The SSH configuration management API should follow RESTful principles:

```yaml
Endpoints:
  GET /api/ssh/hosts - List all SSH hosts
  POST /api/ssh/hosts - Create new SSH host
  GET /api/ssh/hosts/{id} - Get specific SSH host
  PUT /api/ssh/hosts/{id} - Update SSH host
  DELETE /api/ssh/hosts/{id} - Delete SSH host
  POST /api/ssh/hosts/{id}/test - Test SSH connection
  
  GET /api/ssh/keys - List SSH keys
  POST /api/ssh/keys - Create/import SSH key
  DELETE /api/ssh/keys/{id} - Delete SSH key
  
  POST /api/ssh/import - Import OpenSSH config
  GET /api/ssh/export - Export SSH configurations
```

## Monitoring Integration Points

### Health Monitoring
- Periodic SSH connection health checks
- Connection latency and performance metrics
- Automatic alerting for failed connections

### Workflow Integration
- n8n nodes for SSH configuration retrieval
- Dynamic host selection based on monitoring requirements
- Failure handling and automatic failover

### Reporting and Analytics
- SSH connection usage statistics
- Security compliance reporting
- Performance and reliability metrics

## Deployment Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Secure key storage backend (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, etc.)
- High-availability database for configuration storage
- Load balancing for API endpoints
- Backup and disaster recovery for SSH configurations

### Migration Strategy
- Import tools for existing SSH configurations
- Gradual migration from manual to centralized management
- Rollback capabilities for configuration changes
