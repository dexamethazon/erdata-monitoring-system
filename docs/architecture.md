# System Architecture

## Overview

The erdata-monitoring-system is a hybrid infrastructure monitoring solution that combines the power of n8n workflow automation, SSH-based monitoring, and cloud API integrations to provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities across diverse infrastructure environments.

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

1. **n8n Workflow Engine**
   - Orchestrates monitoring workflows
   - Handles data collection, processing, and alerting
   - Provides visual workflow design and management
   - Supports webhook triggers and scheduled executions

2. **Metric Collection Scripts**
   - Custom scripts for specific monitoring requirements
   - SSH-based remote monitoring capabilities
   - Cloud API integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
   - System performance and health checks

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Real-time metric processing
   - Data normalization and transformation
   - Threshold evaluation and anomaly detection
   - Historical data aggregation

4. **Alerting and Notification System**
   - Multi-channel notification support (email, Slack, SMS)
   - Escalation policies and routing
   - Alert correlation and deduplication
   - Custom alert templates

### Monitoring Targets

- **Infrastructure Servers**: CPU, memory, disk, network metrics via SSH
- **Cloud Resources**: Cloud provider APIs for resource monitoring
- **Applications**: Custom application metrics and health checks
- **Network Devices**: SNMP and ping-based monitoring
- **Databases**: Connection pools, query performance, replication status

## Workflow Architecture

### Data Collection Workflows

```
[Triggers] → [Data Collection] → [Processing] → [Storage] → [Alerting]
```

1. **Scheduled Triggers**: Cron-based execution for regular monitoring
2. **Webhook Triggers**: Event-driven monitoring from external systems
3. **Manual Triggers**: On-demand monitoring execution

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Validation**: Ensure collected metrics meet quality standards
2. **Normalization**: Convert metrics to standard formats
3. **Enrichment**: Add context and metadata to metrics
4. **Threshold Evaluation**: Compare against defined thresholds
5. **Alert Generation**: Create alerts when thresholds are breached

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `N8N_HOST`: n8n instance hostname
- `N8N_PORT`: n8n service port
- `N8N_PROTOCOL`: HTTP/HTTPS protocol
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: Base URL for webhook endpoints
- `DB_CONNECTION`: Database connection string for metrics storage

### Workflow Configuration

- **Collection Intervals**: Define monitoring frequency per workflow
- **Retention Policies**: Data retention settings for metrics
- **Alert Thresholds**: Configurable warning and critical thresholds
- **Notification Channels**: Target channels for alerts

### Security Configuration

- **SSH Key Management**: Secure key storage for remote access
- **API Credentials**: Encrypted storage of cloud provider credentials
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and access controls
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Deployment Architecture

### Single Node Deployment

```
[n8n Instance] ← → [Scripts] ← → [Target Systems]
```

### Distributed Deployment

```
[Load Balancer] → [n8n Cluster] → [Shared Storage]
       ↓
[Monitoring Scripts] → [Target Infrastructure]
```

## Data Flow

1. **Collection Phase**
   - Scripts execute on schedule or trigger
   - Data collected from target systems
   - Raw metrics sent to processing pipeline

2. **Processing Phase**
   - Data validation and cleansing
   - Metric normalization and enrichment
   - Storage in time-series database

3. **Analysis Phase**
   - Threshold comparison
   - Trend analysis
   - Anomaly detection

4. **Action Phase**
   - Alert generation
   - Notification delivery
   - Automated remediation (when configured)

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple n8n instances with load balancing
- **Database Scaling**: Time-series database clustering
- **Metric Partitioning**: Separate workflows by system type or criticality
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed metrics

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Self-Monitoring**: Monitor the monitoring system itself
- **Performance Metrics**: Track workflow execution times and success rates
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and alerting
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource utilization monitoring

## Security Model

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for system access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all monitoring activities
- **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection regulations

## Integration Points

### External Systems

- **ITSM Tools**: ServiceNow, Jira Service Management
- **Chat Platforms**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Email Systems**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **Ticketing Systems**: Automatic ticket creation for critical alerts

### APIs

- **REST APIs**: For external system integration
- **GraphQL**: For flexible data querying
- **Webhooks**: For real-time event notifications
- **Message Queues**: For asynchronous processing

## Disaster Recovery

- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of workflows and configuration
- **Failover Procedures**: Automated failover to secondary systems
- **Recovery Procedures**: Step-by-step recovery documentation
- **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing schedule
