## Feature Request: SSH Configuration Management System

### Summary
Implement a comprehensive SSH configuration management system within the monitoring infrastructure to streamline SSH host management, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency.

### Problem Statement
Currently, managing SSH configurations for monitoring remote systems lacks centralized control, standardization, and security best practices. Manual SSH configuration management is error-prone, time-consuming, and poses security risks when dealing with multiple hosts, jump servers, and varying authentication methods.

### Proposed Solution
Develop an integrated SSH configuration management module that provides:

#### Core Functionality
- **SSH Host Management**: Add, edit, and delete SSH host entries
- **Connection Parameters**: Configure host/IP addresses, usernames, ports, and connection settings
- **Authentication Management**: Handle SSH keys, identity files, and authentication methods
- **Advanced Networking**: Support for bastion/jump hosts and complex network topologies
- **Configuration Import/Export**: Import and export OpenSSH-formatted configuration files

#### Advanced Features
- **ProxyJump Support**: Configure multi-hop SSH connections through bastion hosts
- **SSH Agent Integration**: Seamless integration with SSH agent for key management
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection reuse for monitoring tasks
- **Health Checking**: Automated SSH connection health monitoring

### Use Cases

#### 1. Multi-Environment Management
**Scenario**: DevOps team managing development, staging, and production environments
- Configure environment-specific SSH settings
- Manage different authentication methods per environment
- Maintain isolation between environments while enabling monitoring

#### 2. Bastion Host Configuration
**Scenario**: Accessing servers in private networks through jump hosts
- Configure ProxyJump settings for multi-hop connections
- Manage bastion host credentials and access patterns
- Enable secure monitoring of isolated infrastructure

#### 3. Large-Scale Infrastructure Monitoring
**Scenario**: Monitoring hundreds of servers across multiple data centers
- Bulk import of SSH configurations from existing OpenSSH config files
- Standardize SSH settings across server fleets
- Centralize credential management and rotation

#### 4. Compliance and Security Auditing
**Scenario**: Meeting security compliance requirements
- Track SSH configuration changes and access patterns
- Implement SSH key rotation workflows
- Maintain audit logs for SSH access and configuration modifications

#### 5. Disaster Recovery Planning
**Scenario**: Maintaining monitoring capabilities during infrastructure failures
- Export SSH configurations for backup and disaster recovery
- Quick reconfiguration of monitoring systems
- Failover SSH connection management
