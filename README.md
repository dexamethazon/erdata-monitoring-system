# ER Data Monitoring System

A comprehensive hybrid infrastructure monitoring solution that combines n8n workflow automation, SSH-based monitoring, and cloud API integrations to provide real-time insights and alerting across diverse infrastructure environments.

## üöÄ Features

- **Visual Workflow Design**: Leverage n8n's intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating monitoring workflows
- **Hybrid Infrastructure Support**: Monitor on-premises servers, cloud resources, and hybrid environments
- **Multi-Protocol Monitoring**: SSH, SNMP, HTTP/HTTPS, and cloud API integrations
- **Real-time Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications via email, Slack, SMS, and webhooks
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for both single-node and distributed deployments
- **Custom Metrics**: Extensible script-based monitoring for specific requirements
- **Self-Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring of the monitoring system itself
- **Security-First**: Encrypted credentials, secure communication, and audit logging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **n8n Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates all monitoring activities
- **Metric Collection Scripts**: Custom scripts for specialized monitoring needs
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Real-time data normalization and analysis
- **Alerting System**: Intelligent alert routing and escalation
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment-specific overrides

For detailed architecture information, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- n8n installed globally or via Docker
- SSH access to target systems (for SSH-based monitoring)
- Cloud provider credentials (for cloud resource monitoring)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dexamethazon/erdata-monitoring-system.git
   cd erdata-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Install n8n** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # Via npm
   npm install -g n8n
   
   # Or via Docker
   docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   export N8N_HOST=localhost
   export N8N_PORT=5678
   export N8N_PROTOCOL=http
   ```

4. **Start n8n**
   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

5. **Access the n8n interface**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5678`
   - Import workflows from the `n8n-workflows/` directory

### Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Copy example environment files and customize for your environment
   - Configure database connections for metric storage
   - Set up notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

2. **Workflow Import**
   - Import pre-built workflows from `n8n-workflows/`
   - Customize triggers, schedules, and thresholds
   - Configure target systems and credentials

3. **Script Deployment**
   - Deploy monitoring scripts from `scripts/` to appropriate systems
   - Configure SSH keys and access permissions
   - Test script execution and data collection

### Development

1. **Adding New Workflows**
   - Create workflows in n8n interface
   - Export as JSON files to `n8n-workflows/`
   - Document workflow purpose and configuration

2. **Custom Scripts**
   - Add new monitoring scripts to `scripts/`
   - Follow naming conventions: `{target-type}-{metric-name}.{ext}`
   - Include error handling and logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Update architecture documentation for significant changes
   - Maintain README for new features or configuration changes
